    "This notebook guides you through the implementation and execution of a sample climate indicator exploiting the features provided by the *ECAS* environment and, in particular, those provided by the **Ophidia Framework**. The *ENES Climate Analytics Service* (ECAS) is one of the *EOSC-Hub Thematic Services*. It builds on top of the Ophidia big data analytics framework with additional components and services from the INDIGO-DataCloud software stack, EUDAT and EGI e-infrastructures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this training is to give an overview of the features available in ECAS while implementing a real indicator from the *extreme climate indices* set. This list comprises 27 indices based on daily temperatures or daily precipitation amount, defined with the purpose to analyze extreme events. The indicator that you're going to implement during this training is the *Daily temperature range (DTR)*: i.e. the monthly mean difference between the maximum and minimum daily temperatures. The full list of indices is provided [http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/list_27_indices.shtml](http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/list_27_indices.shtml).\n",
    "\n",
    "The training session will be completely carried out in this Jupyter Notebook using python code and the set of modules and libraries available in the ECASlab. Among these, one of the main modules is PyOphidia, the Ophidia python bindings, which integrates the features to interact with the Ophidia Framework, B2DROP and python environment. Please run the code blocks in the order specified to avoid any issue.\n",
